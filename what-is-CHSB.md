# What is the CHSB?
CHSB is a cryptocurrency which can be defined using 2 main characteristics, it is an ERC20 and a utility token. Let's dive into more details to explore the ins and out of the CHSB. 

## An ERC20 token
It is an ERC20 token, hence it uses the scripting standard of the Ethereum blockchain. Being an ERC20 token, it has the following functionalities:
- transfering tokens from one account to another
- getting the current token balance of an account
- getting the total supply of the token available on the network
- approve weither an amount of token can be spent by a 3rd party account

There are several advantages of following this standard :
- being part of the ERC20 ecosystem: several other tokens use it, which allow a smooth interaction with one another 
- secured and fast transaction
- reducing the risk of contract breaking
- popular and easy-to-use

## A multi-utility token
This signifies that it funds the development of cryptocurrency while giving benefits to holder when using SwissBorg services.

### CHSB Yield Program
Owning CHSB can enable you to earn a yield on the tokens you own. You can then decide to transfer and lock some tokens into a yield wallet for a given amount of time which will enable the owner to eard a passive yield.

### Community Index
In order to calculate the yield on CHSB, CHSB uses its community index which is an indicator which measures the health of the Swissborg ecosystem.  The higher it is, the higher the yield is too.

### Protect and Burn mechanism
This mechanism uses the law of demand and supply to interact with the value of the CHSB. SwissBorg saves 20% of its revenues to periodically buy back their coin(burn), hence reducing the amount of coins available (on the basis that reducing the supply while the demand stays the same should increase the value). Looking at the numbers, this mechanism actually acts a virtuous circle : in 77% of the cases, the price of the CHSB was higher in the week following the burn.

### Premium membership
One of the incentive to own CHSB is to lock them for 12months to join the Premium account benefits which will then give the holder a much higher yield and significantly reduced fees.

### Participate in Referendums
Despite not being a security token, SwissBorg has held the first Cryptocurrencies referendum allowing its token holders to propose initiatives to be added to SwissBorg's development roadmap.
